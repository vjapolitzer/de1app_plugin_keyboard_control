# de1app plugin - keyboard_control
Control your non-GHC DE1 with a keyboard!

## Usage
When enabled and used in conjunction with a keyboard:  
- Press `e` to start espresso.
    - Press `e` (or `s`, `w`, `f`, or any non-configured letter key) to stop. 
        - If enable_next_step_tap is toggled to true, Press `e` or `s` to move to next step in advanced profile, press `w`, `f`, or any non-configured letter key to stop.
- Press `s` to start steaming
    - Press `s` (or `e`, `w`, `f`, or any non-configured letter key) to stop.
- Press `w` to start hot water
    - Press `w` (or `e`, `s`, `f`, or any non-configured letter key) to stop.
- Press `f` to start flushing
    - Press `f` (or `e`, `s`, `w`, or any non-configured letter key) to stop.  
    
The functions can be configured to different letter keys in the extension settings page. Additionally, move to next step in advanced profile can be enabled.

NOTE: The function that keeps the navbar hidden may also block keypresses. If this is the case for you, using the `ctrl` modifier may work as a hack to get the keypress through. i.e. `ctrl+e` to start (or stop) an espresso. This may not work with non-letter keys, so the plugin currently only supports letter keys.
